# Welcome to the Controls Wiki

This is your comprehensive guide to control systems engineering. Whether you’re a student, professional engineer, or curious learner, this wiki will help you understand the fundamental concepts and advanced topics in control theory.

## What You’ll Learn

This wiki covers a wide range of topics including:

- **Classical Control Theory**: Transfer functions, frequency response, and stability analysis
- **Modern Control Theory**: State-space methods, optimal control, and robust control
- **Digital Control Systems**: Discrete-time systems and digital implementation
- **Advanced Topics**: Nonlinear control, adaptive control, and intelligent control systems

## Getting Started

If you’re new to control systems, we recommend starting with the basic concepts:

1. **System Modeling** - Learn how to represent physical systems mathematically
1. **Transfer Functions** - Understand the relationship between inputs and outputs
1. **Stability Analysis** - Determine if a system will remain stable over time
1. **Controller Design** - Design controllers to achieve desired system behavior
